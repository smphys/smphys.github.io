Mahe Taiba Hussain joined the Ph.D. program in 2023 and is currently engaged in advanced research on chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) functionalized with chiral biomolecules. Her work aims to explore the
fundamental mechanisms of spin-dependent electron transport in these systems. In addition to this, she is also developing graphite-based
electrochemical sensors with enhanced sensitivity for the selective detection of biologically significant molecules. This ongoing aspect of research focuses on improving the limit of detection and selectivity, with potential applications in biosensing. During her free time, she enjoys taking scenic pictures and listening to music.
