Abhinandan Kumar is a PhD student at NIT Patna, where he has been pursuing his research since July
2021. His work focuses on the Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect, studying spin-dependent
charge transport through organic molecules and 2D materials like MoS₂. By tailoring molecular and
structural asymmetries, he aims to understand how chirality influences spin polarization in nanoscale
systems. Alongside this, he is also involved in developing electrochemical techniques for biomolecule
detection using potentiostatic methods.
