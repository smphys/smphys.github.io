Katharine is interested in how environmental changes--including climate change, habitat fragmentation, and mass incarceration--shape our pathogen exposures and determine who gets sick. She is committed to mentoring the next generation of scientists and public health advocates. 

Outside of work, she is often at a nearby trailhead.
