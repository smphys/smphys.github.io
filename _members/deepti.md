Deepti is currently pursuing her PhD at NIT Patna, where she has been engaged in research since September 2020. Her primary area of interest is biosensors, with a focus on creating affordable and eco-friendly materials for detecting various biomolecules. She employs electrochemical techniques for biomolecule detection and is also involved in the simulation-based design of field-effect transistor (FET) structures for biosensing applications.
