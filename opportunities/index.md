We are committed to creating an inclusive, safe research community that invites and supports students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. We are committed to anti-racist, anti-imperialist, abolitionist research program and group culture. 

We have many open opportunities for students interested in Experimental Condensed matter Physics, Experimental BioPhysics, Thin Filmls, and Soft Matter. Please reach out to discuss your interests—we’re looking forward to meeting you and learning with you!
