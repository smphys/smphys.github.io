# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

We develop and apply evolutionary approaches to answer open questions about pathogen transmission & epidemiological dynamics with a current focus on M. tuberculosis. Our goal is to directly inform public health in low-income settings.

# Investigating Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) in 2D-TMDs functionalized with Chiral Biomolecules

Pathogens are constantly evolving and individual infections often contain diverse populations of pathogens, within-host variation. Yet most genomic epidemiology studies rely on consensus sequences, generating a single representative genome, discarding potentially valuable epidemiological information. We have integrated deep sequencing and epidemiological data to measure the epidemiological information in SARS-CoV-2 within-host variation. We are currently developing approaches to measure within-host M. tuberculosis use this information to study transmission.
